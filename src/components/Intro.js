        I am a creative web designer and front-end developer with a background in education.
        My goal is to use my problem solution mindset and knowledge about learning, to help
        entrepreneurs and small businesses create personalized websites that showcase their
        strengths, USP and passion to start a project. In the process I also include training
        hours and teach clients how to use the website platform and make changes by themselves.
